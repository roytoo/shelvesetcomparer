# ShelvesetComparer.Next
A visual studio extension that allow users to compere contents of two shelvesets.
It's originated from sorces [https://github.com/hamidshahid/shelvesetcomparer]

I found it interesting and want to learn more about VS extensions.
The first improvement I decided to do is compare files within same VS instance, and its done.
